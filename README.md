# SubPar project tracker
_v1 Desu yo_

## What is it?
A service to keep track of your groups projects and where they're at.

It takes the form of a single service API, which you can use to retrieve the status of a project or update projects.
There is a separate CLI program included for an admin to add new project and API tokens

## The API

The API that this spins up is documented in `/docs/api-spec.json`. It's an OpenAPI v3 spec. You can use [the online API editor/viewer](https://editor.swagger.io/) to help read it if you'd like.

## Dependant Infrastructure:

This project requires a MySQL database to be configured, the specification for which is in `docs/database.json`. It's designed to be used with [Mysql-DB-Builder](https://github.com/Chrolo/Mysql-DB-Builder).
__note__: if the version in `docs/database.json` seems to be out of date, you can just run `npm run build:databaseDef` to generate a newer version.

## CLI
The CLI is there to help manage the system for someone with terminal access to the machine this system.
__It is assumed that such a person has full admin rights to this app__, because with that kind of access they could just change the code of the app to make it do what they want.

### running the CLI
The CLI can be run with `node src/cli/`. From there you should be able to use `help` to find out all you need.

### What can be done?
- Create a configuration file for your setup
- Add new api tokens
- Revoke old api tokens
- Add new staff members.


## Config.json
The program will automatically attempt to load a `config.json` from the project root, which will be used for configuration of the system on startup. You can specify an alternative config file using the `-c` flag at startup. Any file that can be parsed by NodeJs that returns a javascript object will do (you can write it as a `.js` file to be evaluated at runtime and/or obtain secrets from other areas of the system)


### `mysql`
